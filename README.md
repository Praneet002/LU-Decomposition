# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. import numpy library using import statement.
2. From scipy package import lu().
3. Get input from user and pass it as an array
4. Get P, L U martix using lu().
5. print L and U matrix. 

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```
/*

```
(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix
```
/*

```
~~~
import numpy as np
import scipy
from scipy.linalg import lu
A = eval(input())
P,L,U=lu(A)
print(L)
print(U)
~~~

## Output:
![lu decomposition](https://github.com/Praneet002/LU-Decomposition/blob/main/Screenshot%20(8).png?raw=true)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
